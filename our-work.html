							<h3>Bespoke cupboards and shelving units</h3>
							<p>We were set the challenge of designing and creating two identical, bespoke cupboards and shelving units, sized specifically to allow for the height of vinyl records and a record player. The cupboards were constructed and after a fresh coat of paint on the shelves and the entire room, an old study became a rather lovely ‘play’ room which can now be enjoyed by the family. </p>

							<p>The developers clearly hadn’t considered the functionality fully before the sale as there was no existing storage space. Ionic builds stepped in and designed and built two enormous bespoke wardrobes, one with a concealed locking system, for the purpose of keeping the contents out of bounds from Airbnber’s!</p>

							<h3>Sash windows & double glazing installation</h3>
							<p>We undertook a complete overhaul of the sash windows in a property on the doorstep of Durdham Downs. The exterior of the windows were in desperate need of refurbishment and the only existing draught excluders were originally duct tape. One of the windows was rotten beyond repair.<br>
							We installed all double-glazed units, full draught excluders and decorated each window, with new brass handles and latches, to closely match the existing furnishings throughout the property.
