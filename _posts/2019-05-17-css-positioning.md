CSS positioning is something that trips even the most senior of developers up. In this tutorial, I will go through each different type, and how to use them in a simple, easy way.

Ok, jokes aside, positioning objects in CSS can often be quite a daunting task. There are 4 main types of positioning, some which you will use all the time! Others, not so much.


- Absolute Positioning
- Relative Positioning
- Fixed Positioning
- Sticky Positioning
- Static Positioning

Well, if you didn't get it, it seems we're in a bit of a sticky!
Again.

## Absolute Positioning
Absolute positioning is probably the most wideley used of the <kbd>position</kbd> values. It's great for centering things, and for placing elements where usually it would be hard to without a load of extra divs.

### How to use it
We position our element by setting <kbd>position: absolute</kbd> and using <kbd>top</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd>, <kbd>bottom</kbd> and <kbd>left</kbd> to place it. By default, these values will be referring to the <kbd>body</kbd> element.

For example, this code...
```css
.container{
    position: relative;
}
.fullscreen-div{
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    top: 0;
}
```

When you position an element 'absolutely' it needs to have a container that it is positioned 'relative' to. I know, this may sound confusing... there is already a <kbd>position: relative</kbd>, right?

Well, that's the thing, to positio
