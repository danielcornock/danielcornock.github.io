If you're an active member of the tech community, I'd be surprised if you hadn't heard of #100DaysOfCode.

## My Experience
MY first real experience documenting things.

It was what helped me to come involved in the tech society. I'm now part of a coding group.

On days where I didn't have motivation, I did some work to stick to the goal and that turned into organic motivation.
