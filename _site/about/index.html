                    <p>
                        My interest in computers and programming stems from back in 2013, when a friend of mine introduced me to coding. I used visual basic to develop a few simple apps, including a guitar chord picker and a tool to help me with my current A-level revision. Doing this really opened my eyes to how fun coding can be, and the abilities that you gain just by having simple knowledge.</p>
                    <p>    
                        Around the same time as this, I built my own computer in the switch from console to PC gaming, and without sounding too crazy, I'd say it was one of the most fun things I've ever done - making all of the pieces fit together, troubleshooting, and then ending up with a great gaming computer for a fraction of the price of a pre-built one was a great feeling, and I wanted MORE!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Ultimately this lead to me changing my aspirational career path from an accountant/economist/teacher (being 17 is a very indecisive time!) to become someone that does <i>something</i> to do with computers. So, from there I applied for multiple courses across the country from game development to computer science, and ended up happily in my hometown doing computer systems engineering at the University of Birmingham.</p>
                    
                   <p>My degree covered many areas, from logic, assembly and microprocessors to using C and Java to develop our own programs. I gained valuable experience in hard skills and soft skills, with management and group projects which included building a robot that followed a line along the floor.</p>
                    
                    <p>I graduated from the University of Birmingham with a 2:1 in Computer Systems Engineering in July 2017. From there, I decided to take a break from education and spent the following year travelling around Australia with my girlfriend whilst she took part in a year abroad for her psychology degree.</p>
                    
                    <p>Towards the end of my time away, I started applying for various jobs and graduate schemes for when I got back. I reached the interview stage for a few of these, but quickly realised that the skills that I gained from my degree would not be enough on their own to land me a job in development.</p>
                    
                    <p>So, while working at the student accomodation at the university to keep me going, I started looking for technologies that I would both enjoy, and would give me plenty of choice when looking for a job.</p>
                    
                    <p>I went through many technologies, many of which felt very pointless, without something to be aiming for.</p>
                    
                    <p>Eventually I found freecodecamp and started their tutorials on HTML and CSS. I found the ability to be able to see something tangible being made very addictive, and the idea that I could create me very own website that people could look at was very exciting.</p>
                    <p>I completed the basic projects, and then started learning JavaScript, and that's when I became thirsty. I was thirsty to learn new things, and it felt like front-end web development had almost too many things that I needed to learn.</p>
                    
                    <p>From there, I have completed a few projects for co-workers and friends, from static sites to wordpress. My job search also came to a happy end, being accepted into a software firm in Nottingham that uses Angular to create HR solutions as a single page application.</>
